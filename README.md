# LofiBox
This is a project for IDMT 2019 Cruft 2 named **LofiBox**. The idea is to use abandoned acrylic to make a Lo-fi (low fidelity) music box. Users can touch each side to listen to separate component of Lo-fi music. They can also combine these elements to full songs.

This project is implemented using [Processing 3.5.3](https://processing.org/download/) & [Arduino 1.8.10](https://www.arduino.cc/). Hardware part includes:

* arduino uno 
* breadboard
* capacitive sensor
* copper tapes
* strip boards and wires
* headpins and crimp terminals

The software interface visualizes users' touch on the pad, as well as the amplitude and the spectrum of the sound collected by microphone.
